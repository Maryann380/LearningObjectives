#Learning how to create a scrollbar using javascript
=======

Here i learned how to create and style a customScrollbar using jquery pluggings. Although it took me a bit longer than i expected to get it but i got there at the end. when i first started working on this scrollbar i was getting confused on why do we really need a jquery when we are already using the "overflow:auto", i kept playing this in my head for a full week and a bit cause it didnt make sense to me, But I finally got it working and i release that the jquery plugging was actually just for use to customise the scrollbar the way we like and thing more.
